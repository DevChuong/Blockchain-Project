How multi-layering security is possibly put in the requirements and available assets of the application.

System, application software security -------> Crypto security ---------> Information

Both system and application software security could be implemented with the exception of following methodologies :

+ Identify then analyse different data workflows.
+ Digital certification (mainly digital signature, learning badges is recommended in our project)
+ Policy for securing and defining essential datas to be highly protected.
+ Authentication.
+ Cryptography.

To protect the information assets, there are various crypto security methods available for stakeholders. Some methods are quite common and basic.
Stakeholders must be aware of potential vulnerablities that could cause losses from these methods.

+ Two factors authentication should be applied when a supervisor verified the QR code whose trainee he was providing supervision.
+ Own a private key. Corroborated by related stakeholders (those got involved in signing and confirming learning plan, trainee profile)
+ Blockchain, for storing hashed data.
+ Decentralization between related stakeholders.
