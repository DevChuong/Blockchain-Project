Contents of the meeting : 
- discussing mainly about security requirements, the diagrams and needed security.
- Learning Plan in application : come to confirm that learning plan is a function in the application.
- Talking about stakeholders (national security, Curriculum institutional education program) and their workflow.
- Asking if the Institutional educational program is only for paperwork without the application (?)
- Individual learning plan is based on other document and doesn't have to be on application.
- The hierachy represents all the different tasks that need to be matched, this is kinda a national learning plan.
- Asking if a column like common task is an EPA (?)
- Asking about the copy profile, like the mentor access to trainee profile then he will 
document trainee’s profile on paper , to see if its still a paperwork. (?)

- The trainee should able to create a digital copy like a snapshot to his pf and send to his mentor. Only send 
the digital copy without sensitive information, can be digital, can be sent to the mentor.

- The mentor could send that copy to ProgramD, the necessary people can sign and handle off to the national authorities.
- Asking If a trainee can send his snapshot pf to the mentor, and it is also function in the application. (?)
- The most sensitive data is the active data where everyone could see. Only people need to see is trainee ( see for himself) 
or supervisor that worked with trainee to assign appropriate task.

-	And all the other like official requirement need to sign some paper to make sure trainee progressing. 
They only work with snapshot. They don’t need to access the active profile. 

-	And this is more safe for trainee. The copy will be sent to mentor and PD ( who will send 
to national authorities which will come to logbook )

-	The trainee will send to mentor then they will discuss the profile then if they agree the content, they could 
send to PD. They will sign both and send to PD. The PD will sign and send to national logbook.

- The supervisor just meet the person they are working with so don’t have official role in signing document. 
Supervisor just a every day rater.
